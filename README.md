# 3d-printed-labial-pipe

This is the FreeCAD file that will help you to print a part of a labial pipe, to be used with a piece of tube. Because most organ pipes don't fit into most 3d-printers.

Please start by adding the desired measurements into the spreadsheet.

I'd be happy if you tell me about your instrument!
