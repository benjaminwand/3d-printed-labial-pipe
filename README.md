# 3d-printed labial pipe

## General
This is a FreeCAD file that will help you to print a part of a labial pipe, to be used with a piece of tube. Because most organ pipes don't fit into most 3d-printers.

Please start by adding the desired measurements into the spreadsheet.

I'd be happy to hear about your instrument!

## Version History
0.1 First attempt for pipes with 60mm diameter, made with tinkercad.com <br>
0.2 Fully proportional pipe part as FreeCad file

## Desigh Thoughts
I was pondering the design of flue pipes from wood and metal and came to the conclusion that the design has a lot to do with the material. Wooden pipes are built angular because that is easier than woodturning, and metal pipes are made in a round shape because less soldering. So, what would be a good design for 3D-printing? Well, something with a flat base would be handy. But then, most 3D-printers can’t print large enough for most organ pipes, organ pipes get really large you know, so I wanted to use tubes from the hardware store and only 3D-print the intricate part, therefore the 3D-printed organ pipes would be round. I made the outside hexagonal because that offers the best ratio of stablie vs. little space consuming.
In order to be compatible with organ builders (and people who work with wood in general), the foot would be round like in wooden organ pipes, so it would be suitable with a somewhat normal windchest design. However, I don’t think it is necessary to have the foot in the middle of the cup, having it off, like in a recorder, made the design easier (I was thinking of getting the support structure removed after printing) while I’m not aware of substantial disadvantages.

## Future plans
* I have not heared any of them yet, 3d-printing is slower than expected.
* Next, I'll design a pipe part for organ pipes with inverted free reed. (Invention of Ernst Zacharias, see "Die dynamische Orgel." Instrumentenbau-Zeitschrift 1999, Heft 7-8, S. 26 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkmdJ6xWm4)
* I actually want to build a small organ.
